Mark Westaway & Son,"We are the pioneers and world leaders in dust-free forage for horses.  In 1976 a suggestion was made to Mark Westaway that someone should produce a forage especially for horses.

It is now produced by Mark Westaway and Son and other franchisees, for sale throughout the UK and is exported to most EU countries.<break><break>The original RyeGrass HorseHage has been joined by High Fibre and Timothy HorseHage.  A Royal Warrant was awarded in 1983 after the Queen's horse, Burmese, was fed HorseHage when suffering a respiratory problem.  He is one of tens of thousands of ponies and horses, from Shetlands to Thoroughbreds, that have benefited from HorseHage's dust-free properties.  HorseHage has also been supplied to the British Equestrian Teams at every Olympics from Los Angeles in 1984 through to Hong Kong in 2008. HorseHage is fed to horses in the Royal Mews.<break><break>Mark Westaway gives two main reasons for the success of HorseHage.  HorseHage is a natural product with no additives and contains most of the benefits of fresh grass.  It not only helps the horse's respiratory system but its digestive system too.
